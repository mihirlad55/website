        <p>Hi, I'm Mihir Lad, a Computer Engineering student at Florida Polytechnic University expected to graduate in 2022. My concentration is Autonomous Robotic Systems.</p>
        <p>I love technology and making things from wood to software, especially when others can enjoy the final product as much as I do. Anything that requires efficient design, logical thinking, and creativity is right up my alley.</p>
        <p>That being said, robotics is my passion. With 4 years of robotics experience in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering and as the current President of Purple Fire Robotics, I am determined to improve the world through robotics and automation.</p>
