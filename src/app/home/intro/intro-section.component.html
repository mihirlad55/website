      <p>Hi, I'm Mihir Lad, a Computer Engineering student at <a href="https://floridapoly.edu">Florida Polytechnic
          University</a> expected to graduate in 2022. My concentration is Autonomous Robotic Systems.</p>
      <p>I love technology and making things from wood work to software, especially when others can enjoy the final
        product as much as I do. Anything that requires efficient design, logical thinking, and creativity is right up
        my alley.</p>
      <p>That being said, robotics is my passion. With 4 years of robotics experience in mechanical, electrical, and
        software engineering and as the current President of Purple Fire Robotics, I am determined to improve the world
        through robotics and automation.</p>
